<p><strong>Your Personal, Vulgar Grace Field Guide</strong><br>
<strong>Version 1.5 – Created by William Barbeau in collaboration with Michael Sanzo</strong><br>
<strong>Updated: January 2026</strong></p>

<h2 id="introduction-why-this-guide-exists">Introduction: Why This Guide Exists</h2>
<p>If you’re like me — grinding AI image gen but ending up with shiny, soulless crap that could be anyone’s — this is your wake-up call.</p>
<p>This isn’t another prompt cookbook. It’s a mindset reset to make AI your bitch, not the other way around.</p>
<p><strong>Who this is for:</strong> Creators (artists, designers, storytellers) with basic AI tool experience (e.g., you’ve run Midjourney or Flux a few times) who want output that screams <em>you</em>, not the model’s defaults.</p>
<p><strong>What you’ll get:</strong> A crash course in directing AI like a film boss, plus workflows to apply it daily. No fluff, just tools to reclaim your voice.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Access to an AI image gen tool (Grok, Flux, SD3). An open mind to ditch “perfect” for “mine.”</p>
<p>By the end, you’ll spot AI drift from a mile away and bend it to your will. Let’s kill the generic.</p>
<p><strong>Quick engagement check:</strong> What’s one thing in your recent AI output that felt “off” or not quite yours? Jot it down — we’ll come back to it.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-free-tools-for-beginners-hands-on-module">Getting Started: Free Tools for Beginners (Hands-On Module)</h2>
<p>This is your bulk, interactive starter class. If you’re new, on mobile, or running free tiers, begin here. We’ll use the guide’s recurring “quiet regret” vibe as the through-line so everything connects. Do the assignments as you read — generate immediately, journal your observations, compare before/after tweaks. This module takes 2–4 hours total and gives you real pieces to carry forward into the mindset lessons.</p>

<p><strong>Pause and think:</strong> Which tool below excites you most? Start with that one to build momentum.</p>
<h3 id="image-generation">Image Generation</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Grok Image Gen</strong><br>
<strong>Why:</strong> Fast, built into X, great starting quality. Free with limits.<br>
<strong>Setup:</strong> Mobile app or <a href="http://x.com/grok">x.com/grok</a>.<br>
<strong>Assignment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prompt: “Crumbling brutalist apartment at golden hour.” Generate 4 variations.</li>
<li>Journal: What defaults show up (too pretty, symmetrical, hopeful)?</li>
<li>Tweak: Add “melancholic warmth, never cute, never hopeful.” Regenerate.</li>
<li>Save your favorite as <code>regret-base-01.png</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mobile tip:</strong> Tap the Imagine button in the Grok chat.<br>
<strong>Video ref:</strong> Search YouTube “Grok Image Gen Beginner Tutorial 2026”.</p>
<p><strong>Try Now:</strong> Generate right now if you can. How does the tweak change the feel? Share your thoughts in a quick note.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hugging Face Spaces</strong><br>
<strong>Why:</strong> Browser-based, tons of free models, no app needed.<br>
<strong>Setup:</strong> <a href="http://huggingface.co/spaces">huggingface.co/spaces</a> → search “Flux” or “SD3”.<br>
<strong>Assignment:</strong> Use the same base prompt as above. Generate, then add the same negative/anchor. Compare results to Grok. Save a second base image.<br>
<strong>Mobile tip:</strong> Works perfectly in phone browser; pinch to zoom.</p>
<p><strong>Quick quiz:</strong> Which tool gave more raw, personal results? Why do you think that?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="video-generation">Video Generation</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://Viggle.ai">Viggle.ai</a></strong><br>
<strong>Why:</strong> Excellent image-to-video, mobile-friendly. Free daily credits.<br>
<strong>Setup:</strong> App or web.<br>
<strong>Assignment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upload your saved regret image.</li>
<li>Motion prompt: “Slow camera drift left to right, subtle reveal of abandoned objects, dust drifting.”</li>
<li>Generate clip. Journal weird motion artifacts.</li>
<li>Tweak: Add “never hopeful, no dramatic zoom.” Save <code>regret-video-01.mp4</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Video ref:</strong> “Viggle Beginner Tutorial 2026” on YouTube.</p>
<p><strong>Engagement Hook:</strong> Watch your clip — does the motion amplify the regret or dilute it? Adjust and see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kling AI (or current free alternative)</strong><br>
<strong>Why:</strong> Strong physics and longer clips.<br>
<strong>Assignment:</strong> Repeat the image-to-video exercise. Compare motion feel to Viggle.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="audio--music">Audio &amp; Music</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://Uberduck.ai">Uberduck.ai</a></strong><br>
<strong>Why:</strong> Quick ambient sounds and effects.<br>
<strong>Assignment:</strong> Prompt “Distant traffic, occasional floor creak, quiet resentment at 3 AM — no music swell.” Generate 20–30s loop. Download.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Reflection:</strong> Play it back — does it evoke the vibe, or feel too polished?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Suno</strong><br>
<strong>Why:</strong> Instrumental mood loops. Free credits daily.<br>
<strong>Assignment:</strong> “Melancholic warm piano, like the last day of a relationship you know is over — never uplifting.” Generate 30s. Download.</p>

<li>Apply subtle color grade: desaturated warm tones.</li>
<li>Export final short clip: <code>regret-full-01.mp4</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Journal the whole process:</strong> What felt like AI defaults? Where did one negative or anchor save it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By the end of this module you have a complete multi-medium “quiet regret” piece made entirely on free tools. Carry these files forward — we’ll reference them in later exercises.</p>
<p><strong>Group Challenge Idea:</strong> Share your final clip with a creator friend. Ask: “What vibe do you get?” Use their feedback to tweak.</p>

<h2 id="mini-course-–-director-mindset-crash-course">Mini-Course – Director Mindset Crash Course</h2>
<p><strong>6 Lessons + 1 Daily Habit</strong><br>
Shift from chasing perfect prompts → becoming the undisputed creative director of your AI process.</p>
<p><strong>Before diving in:</strong> Imagine your last AI session — where did you feel like the boss, and where did the tool take over? Keep that in mind as we build your instincts.</p>
<h3 id="key-takeaways-summary-–-the-heart-of-it-all">Key Takeaways Summary – The Heart of It All</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>You are always the Author</strong> — the AI is talented material, never the boss.<br>
<strong>Why?</strong> Giving up authorship = generic, soulless output that doesn’t feel like you.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong> Most people end up with polished AI wallpaper because they let the model decide the emotional tone. You keep the final say on what “feels right,” even if it’s ugly or awkward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>80% of your best work lives in simple, vibe-first prompts</strong> — not ultra-technical ones.<br>
<strong>Why?</strong> Over-control kills intuition and your unique voice.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong> A 12-word vibe prompt like “quiet regret in a crumbling apartment, never cute” beats a 300-word technical monster 9 times out of 10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Negative instructions and emotional anchors beat detailed positive descriptions.</strong><br>
<strong>Why?</strong> They carve out space for your personality instead of forcing a style.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong> Saying “never cute, no inspirational energy” instantly kills 90% of the AI’s default saccharine tendencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The real goal is noticing when the AI is speaking for you</strong> — not making prettier pictures.<br>
<strong>Why?</strong> Sharp intuition about “whose voice is this?” unlocks true creative acceleration.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong> You generate something “beautiful” but feel nothing → you realize it’s the AI’s voice, not yours → you add one negative lever → suddenly it hits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Daily 5-minute ritual &gt; endless tweaking</strong> — small habits build massive control.<br>
<strong>Why?</strong> Consistency trains your director instincts faster than any prompt cookbook.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong> 14 days of quick daily checks and you’ll spot AI drift in seconds instead of hours.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Master this mindset first — everything else (tools, patterns, workflows) becomes 10× more powerful.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Engagement:</strong> Which takeaway resonates most? Circle it and think why.</p>
<h3 id="quick-note-on-tokens-–-why-prompt-style-matters-so-much">Quick Note on Tokens – Why Prompt Style Matters So Much</h3>
<p>Tokens are the chunks the AI actually “reads” (usually 3–5 characters per token).<br>
Long, detailed prompts = more tokens = slower, more expensive, higher drift.<br>
Simple vibe prompts = fewer tokens = faster, cheaper, more room for your intent to dominate.</p>
<p>That’s why we live in Level 1 &amp; 2 — low token count, high authorship.</p>
<p><strong>Try Now:</strong> Count the tokens in a long prompt you’ve used vs. a short vibe one. Notice the difference?</p>

<h3 id="lesson-0-–-core-philosophy-read-once-remember-forever">Lesson 0 – Core Philosophy (Read Once, Remember Forever)</h3>
<p>You are not trying to write the perfect prompt. That’s a trap that leads to frustration and generic results. Instead, you’re training yourself to be a better director of a very talented, slightly literal-minded intern (the AI). Think about it: in film, the director doesn’t build sets or act scenes — they guide the vision. Same here.</p>
<p>Most people treat the AI like a god and beg for perfection, leading to outputs that look impressive but lack soul. You treat it like raw clay — powerful, fast, but shapeless without your hands. Mold it with intent, not force.</p>
<p><strong>Core rule of the entire course:</strong><br>
<em>I am the Author. The AI is talented material. My job is to stay in the Author seat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Example in action:</strong><br>
You generate four variations. Three are technically flawless but feel empty — like stock photos. One is flawed (maybe uneven lighting, awkward composition) but punches you in the chest with real emotion. You push the flawed one because it feels like you. That’s staying in the Author seat.</p>
<p><strong>Expanded context:</strong> This philosophy draws from creative fields like writing or painting, where the tool (pen, brush) serves the artist, not vice versa. If you ever feel “stuck” in AI gen, it’s often because you’ve slipped into the Ally role — letting the tool lead.</p>
<p><strong>Try Now:</strong> Recall a past project. Where did you lose the Author seat? Rewrite one prompt from that memory to reclaim it.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Quiz:</strong> On a scale of 1-10, how often do you currently stay in the Author seat? What would bump it up?</p>
<h3 id="lesson-1-–-the-only-two-roles-that-matter">Lesson 1 – The Only Two Roles That Matter</h3>
<p>People get confused because they try to do both jobs at once, blurring lines and losing control. Let’s break it down clearly.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Role</th>
<th>Who It Is</th>
<th>What They Own / Control</th>
<th>Why It Matters</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Author / Director</strong></td>
<td><strong>You</strong></td>
<td>Vision · Taste · Emotion · Intent · Final decisions</td>
<td>This is where your unique voice lives. Without it, everything feels generic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Materials &amp; Ally</strong></td>
<td>AI + Tools</td>
<td>Speed · Variations · Technical execution · Raw ideas</td>
<td>Great for efficiency, but it has no soul without your guidance.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p><strong>Real example:</strong><br>
You say: “Make it feel like finding an old letter from someone you miss.” (Director — setting the emotional core)<br>
AI spits out four versions fast. (Ally — providing options)<br>
You pick the one that actually hurts a little and push it further. (Director again — owning the choice)</p>
<p><strong>Expanded context:</strong> Think of famous directors like Tarantino or Wes Anderson — their films scream their style because they direct every element. You’re doing the same with AI. If you let the Ally role dominate (e.g., accepting the “prettiest” output), you end up with forgettable work.</p>
<p><strong>Daily reminder (say it out loud before every session):</strong><br>
<em>“I am the author. The AI is very talented material. My job is to stay in the author seat.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Try Now:</strong> Grab your Getting Started regret image. Label Director vs. Ally elements. Tweak one Ally part to make it more yours.</p>
<p><strong>Engagement Question:</strong> Have you ever felt the AI “took over”? What happened, and how can this role split prevent it next time?</p>

<h3 id="lesson-2-–-the-three-prompt-power-levels">Lesson 2 – The Three Prompt Power Levels</h3>
<p>Use this quick decision guide every time you start a session. It’s like choosing gears in a car — wrong one, and you’re stuck in mud.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Level</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Best For</th>

<th>Pro Tip</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Vibe / Attitude Prompt</td>
<td>New ideas, mood exploration, early stages</td>
<td>1–3 sentences</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td>★★★★★</td>
<td>Starting a new piece from pure feeling</td>
<td>Start here 80% of the time for raw energy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Role + Goal + Guardrails</td>
<td>Most daily creative work</td>
<td>1 paragraph</td>

<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Ultra-Precise Technical</td>
<td>Final polish, client-ready output</td>
<td>2–5 paragraphs</td>
<td>★★★★★</td>
<td>★★☆☆☆</td>
<td>Fixing artifacts or matching exact specs</td>
<td>Use sparingly — it’s a finisher, not a starter.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p><strong>Golden rule:</strong><br>
Spend 80% of your energy in Level 1 &amp; 2.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
Level 1: “Quiet resentment at 3 AM, scrolling someone else’s perfect life, never hopeful.” → gets you raw emotional hits fast, sparking ideas without overthinking.<br>
Level 3 on the same idea: 400 words of lighting ratios, lens types, color grades → often ends up sterile, like a product shot instead of art.</p>
<p><strong>Expanded context:</strong> Levels are inspired by creative processes in other fields — sketch loosely first (Level 1), refine with intent (Level 2), polish last (Level 3). Living in Level 3 is like editing a book before writing it: backwards and soul-killing.</p>
<p><strong>Only use Level 3 for finishing</strong> — if you’re living in Level 3, you’re giving away authorship.</p>
<p><strong>Try Now:</strong> Take a seed idea (e.g., “lost connection”). Write one prompt per level. Generate if possible — which felt most engaging?</p>
<p><strong>Interactive Quiz:</strong> For brainstorming a series, which level? (Answer: Level 1). Why? Discuss in your journal.</p>
<h3 id="lesson-3-–-the-four-highest-leverage-prompt-patterns">Lesson 3 – The Four Highest-Leverage Prompt Patterns</h3>
<p>Memorize these four reusable templates — they carry most of the heavy lifting. Think of them as your go-to scripts in a director’s playbook.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Vibe + Contradiction</strong> (best creative starter)<br>
<strong>Example:</strong> <code>Chaotic yet surgically precise, dream-like but brutally honest, like the morning after a fight you know you lost.</code><br>
The contradiction forces the AI out of safe defaults, creating tension that mirrors real emotion.<br>
<strong>Expanded:</strong> Contradictions mimic life — nothing is purely “happy” or “sad.” This pattern injects nuance fast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Director’s Instruction</strong> (keeps you firmly in charge)<br>
